I began coding at 14 years old to create a website for colleges recruiting me for baseball to show off videos, statistics and more on my own terms. I fell in love with the idea of creating something for the world to see, and well, 30+ websites later and I'm still at it. 

I coded throughout high school and college. Delving into topics across the board,but finding my niche in data science and mobile development. I specialized in that for 3-4 years and did stints at the startups Deckstr, and Petpal building out their iOS applications. 

Recently, a study abroad opportunity took me to Frankfurt, Germany where I took a break from Software Engineering to work at a bowling alley. This turned into a coffee shop barista, which turned into a food truck manager. I learned a lot about myself in this time - from time-management, relationship building, and leadership to how to run a business and stay innovative - especially during COVID-19.

Now I'm back to writing code, more confident than ever. I have a much more mature understanding of where I fit in the workplace, how I learn best, and what I DON'T know (a real shock, I thought I knew everything!).
